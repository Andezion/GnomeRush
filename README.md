## General info
After many hours spent reading The Hobbit, The Witcher and Lord of the Rings, I decided to play out my fantasy and put it to code. So, I'm proud to show you my medieval-themed wandering game. Mages, knights, dwarves and more! Explore, check it out and find out!
I wrote the game in pure C, using SDL, based on the base. Music, graphics, plot and so on - all my own!

## Gameplay
